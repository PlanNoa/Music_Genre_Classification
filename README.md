# Music_Genre_Classification

Music Genre Classification with Deep Learning.

# Datasets

Finding the right dataset was very difficult. At first, he tried to get a music file from [FreeSound](freesound.org) but it failed to only pick up music files from several files. Second, I tried [FMA Dataset](https://github.com/mdeff/fma) but the download speed was so slow that I found another way. Finally I used [GTZAN](http://marsyasweb.appspot.com/download/data_sets/). This dataset was a little small, but it had accurate data.

I classified thest genres :
  1.  blues<br>
  2.  classical<br>
  3.  country<br>
  4.  disco <br>
  5.  hiphop<br>
  6.  jazz<br>
  7.  metal<br>
  8.  pop<br>
  9.  reggae<br>
  10. rock<br>

# Result

I got only 40% accuracy, but I was able to achieve great results by dividing the music by 30 seconds.
